##Create a data frame from variable vectors
first_name <- c("Vikas","Vijay","Gaurav")
last_name <- c("kamath","thota","wadnerkar")
age <- c(32,33,33)
employee <- data.frame(first_name,last_name,age)

#basic Functions to check the dataframe
trees # Dataframe that is created
?trees # gives information of the dataset if already there 
head(trees) # First 6 columns 
nrow(trees) # Number of rows in the dataset
ncol(trees) #Number of Columns in the dataset
names(trees) # Names of the columns in the dataset
dim(trees) # gives the dimension of the dataset number of rows and columns
summary(trees) # gives the statistics of the data column by column mean,median,mode quartile etc
str(trees) #gives the columns and their datatypes

# Str function in R is the first thing to do to understand the dataset and their columns
?str # help command 
data() # Internal Data sets in R
str(AirPassengers)
str(trees)
str(airquality)

# read file from a URL into R
cd = read.csv("https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/api/views/g4ie-h725/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD") # read a CSV from a URL 
str(airquality) # Structure of the data
summary(airquality) # Summary on the columns will tell count for Label coulmns and Stats for Continuous data 
head(airquality) # Gives the firt 6 columns  
summary(airquality$Temp) # Summary for a specific temperature
airquality$TempdegreeC <- (airquality$Temp - 32 ) * (5/9) # Convetrting and adding new column for Temperature in degree centigrade 
summary(airquality$TempdegreeC) # Summary of degree Centigrade newly created column
