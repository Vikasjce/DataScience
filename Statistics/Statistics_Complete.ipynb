    "# Types of Variables\n",
    "### Numerical/Quantitative\n",
    "We can add subtract and take averages of these variables.\n",
    "1. Continuous\n",
    "can take infinite number of values\n",
    "eg. height, weight\n",
    "2. Discrete\n",
    "take specific values can enumerate\n",
    "eg: number of cars a household holds\n",
    "### Categorical/Qualitative\n",
    "They cannot be added or averaged and are generally characters \n",
    "1. Nominal:\n",
    "No order in them just a variable\n",
    "eg: Origin of the flights or Airports \n",
    "2. Ordinal \n",
    "There is an order in that variable \n",
    "eg: rate the restraurant in very good,good,bad,very bad \n",
    "\n",
    "# Association\n",
    "- when 2 variables have a connection its called Associated or Dependent variable \n",
    "- Associations can be negative or positive\n",
    "- Independent variables are the ones where the 2 variables are not dependent\n",
    "\n",
    "# Studies \n",
    "1. Observational\n",
    "     - they merely observe the data and do not interfere\n",
    "     - Only establish association\n",
    " a. Retrospective data of the past\n",
    " b. Prospective data is collected throught the study\n",
    "2. Experimental study - A random group is selected for study under controlled conditions     \n",
    "-> Causal relationships are established\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation is not causation \n",
    "1. Relation might be opposite\n",
    "2. Confounding Variable a third variable used for causation. This might be a variable which is not seen\n",
    "\n",
    "eg: eating breakfast keeps girls slim ( But is it because of breakfast or a third variable of waking up early called the confounding variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "sample bias \n",
    "Convenience Sample - \n",
    "People who are easily Accesible eg: only your area, friends etc\n",
    "Non Responsive Sample - People do not respond eventhough the intial sampling was Random eg: may be because they are poor , etc.\n",
    "Voluntary Response Bias - People volunteir who have a strong opinion on the matter \n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling Methods \n",
    "1. Simple random Sampling - each case is equally likely to be selected eg: randomly pulling names from the hat \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Stratified sampling\n",
    "divide the population into homogenous groups and then randomly sample from the group \n",
    "eg: males and female group and then randomly sample from the group \n",
    "\n",
    "3. cluster Sampling\n",
    "1. divide the population into heterogenous clusters \n",
    "2. randomly select the clusters \n",
    "3. then sample all observations from these clusters \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Multistage Sampling\n",
    "1. divide the population into heterogenous clusters \n",
    "2. randomly select the clusters \n",
    "3. then randomly sample observations from these clusters \n",
    "\n",
    "Experimental Principles :\n",
    "a. Control - group which does not recieve the treatment \n",
    "b. randomise - \n",
    "c. replicate -\n",
    "d. block - blocking is done when there is randomizing that is required to be done (Effect of the gel on the pro atheletes and amateure atheletes )\n",
    "\n",
    "Placebo - fake treatment used in the control group \tfor medical studies \n",
    "placebo effect - showing change despite being on the placebo\n",
    "blinding - experimental group does not know which group they are in \n",
    "double blind - both the experimental group and the researchers do not know the assignement group \n",
    "\n",
    "visualizing numerical data\n",

    "     non linear - curvy\n",
    " - strength \n",

    "    unimodal - single peak\n",
    "    bimodal - 2 peaks \n",
    "    uniform - no peaks \n",
    "    multimodal - many peaks \n",
    "- Dotplot - useful when individual values are of interest\n",
